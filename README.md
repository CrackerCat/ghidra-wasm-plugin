Module to load WebAssembly files into Ghidra, supporting disassembly and decompilation.

## Features

- Support for all WebAssembly 1.0 opcodes
- Cross-references for function calls and branches
- Cross-references for table entries and globals containing function pointers
- Recovery of the C stack, when the stack pointer is stored in a global variable (typical for compilers like Emscripten)

## Installing

### Prebuilt Extension

The easiest way to install the plugin is as a Ghidra extension. Grab a
[release](https://github.com/nneonneo/ghidra-wasm-plugin/releases) that is
compatible with your version of Ghidra - for example, if you're using Ghidra
10.0.4, download the file beginning with `ghidra_10.0.4_PUBLIC`. You don't need
to unzip the file: simply launch Ghidra, go to "File -> Install Extensions",
select the + icon, and select the zip file. Restart Ghidra to load the extension
and you should be good to go. **Note:** if you upgrade your version of Ghidra,
you will need to upgrade your plugin too.

### Custom Build

If there is no release for your version of Ghidra, or you want to install a
modified version, you may build and install from source instead. You'll need
Gradle and a Java compiler. Run the following commands from the root of this
repository:

```bash
export GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=<path to Ghidra install directory>
gradle buildExtension
```

`GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` should be the directory that contains the Ghidra
installation, i.e. the directory containing `Extensions`, `Ghidra`, `ghidraRun`,
`support` and so on.

If all goes well, the zipped plugin will be placed in the `dist` directory and
can be installed using "File -> Install Extensions" as before.

## Tips

- Many Wasm programs, especially those compiled by Emscripten or Clang, use a
global variable to store the C stack pointer. This plugin will attempt to
automatically detect the C stack pointer during analysis; if it fails, you may
need to set it yourself before performing initial analysis by setting the "C
Stack Pointer" in the Wasm Pre-Analyzer settings.
- By default, the C stack is assumed to grow in the negative direction, i.e.
towards smaller addresses. However, compilers are actually free to choose either
stack direction, and both positive and negative-growing stacks have been
observed in real-world samples. If your C stack grows upwards (e.g. indicated by
an add operation to the C stack pointer in the function prologue rather than a
subtract), select the `pos-stack` compiler when importing the file, or via `Set
Language...` on an existing file in the project window.
- Emscripten will usually translate function pointer calls into calls to
exported `dyncall_` functions, which take a call-type-specific index as the
first parameter. The index is used to index a sub-section of the main function
table (table0) to find the function to call. The included script
`analyze_dyncalls.py` can analyze the `dyncall_` functions, extract the indices,
and rename referenced functions according to their call type and function index
(which will often serve as function pointer values in memory). This can be used
to resolve function pointer references, for example.
- Element segments may be passive, or have offset expressions that depend on
imported globals. In this case, the element segments are not automatically
loaded to the table. You can manually load these segments by calling
`WasmLoader.loadElementsToTable`. For example, to load element segment #0 to
table #1 at offset 2 in Python:

```python
from wasm import WasmLoader
from wasm.analysis import WasmAnalysis
from ghidra.util.task import ConsoleTaskMonitor
monitor = ConsoleTaskMonitor()
WasmLoader.loadElementsToTable(currentProgram, WasmAnalysis.getState(currentProgram).module, 0, 1, 2, monitor)
```
- Similarly, data segments can be manually loaded as well. For example, to load
data segment #5 to memory #0 at offset 0x1000, do the following in Python:

```python
from wasm import WasmLoader
from wasm.analysis import WasmAnalysis
from ghidra.util.task import ConsoleTaskMonitor
monitor = ConsoleTaskMonitor()
WasmLoader.loadDataToMemory(currentProgram, WasmAnalysis.getState(currentProgram).module, 5, 0, 0x1000, monitor)
```

## Limitations and Known Bugs

- Currently, inlining functions (via marking them "In Line") is not supported
and will confuse the decompiler. This is because the inlined function's
references to stack and local variables will affect the caller. I tried to solve
this limitation by injecting code to save and restore stack and locals on
function entry/exit, but ran into a Ghidra limitation - the decompiler does not
inject "uponentry" Pcode into inlined functions.
- Currently, there is no way to change the C stack pointer after initial analysis
(attempting to re-analyze the program with a new C stack pointer will not change
anything).
- Initial analysis and disassembly can be very slow. This is primarily because
Ghidra is quite slow at setting large numbers of context registers.
- Multiple return values are untested and will probably not work.

## Internals

This module uses a pre-analyzer (WasmPreAnalyzer) to analyze all functions and
opcodes, providing contextual information to the SLEIGH disassembler to enable
correct disassembly (for example, operand sizes when they depend on the types in
the value stack, branch target addresses, etc). In order to support recovery of
the C stack, this module converts Wasm stack operations into operations on a
register file. This frees up the decompiler's stack analysis to focus on the
behaviour of the C stack, since the decompiler only supports a single stack.
Additionally, parameter passing and returns are handled by virtual input/output
registers which are copied to/from the stack and locals registers via Pcode
injection.

Four different types of "registers" are defined: input (iN), output (oN), stack
(sN) and locals (lN). Of these, only the locals will be visible in the
disassembly; stack registers will appear in the PCode, and input/output
registers will appear in function types.
